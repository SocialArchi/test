title: Social Architecture 2020             —Theory and Practice
---

__Social Architecture — Theory and Practice__ aims to equip the students with theoretical/historical knowledge of ‘Social Architecture’ as well as practical skills for practicing it. Students will be exposed to key concepts, methods and goals developed in social architecture, an umbrella term that includes community architecture and planning, community design, social design, democratic design, community development, etc. which share a common approach of environmental design that encourages social behaviors leading towards certain public benefits, such as livability, safety, and sustainability. 

Public spaces play an essential role in the modern society: as areas to foster social interactions, places for cultural practices, and spaces to interact with nature. The role of responsible architects, planners, and urban designers is to design such environments that benefit humanity and ecology. However, it is not easy to find work reflecting on this promise in mainstream architecture. To address this issue, ARCHIFEST 2020 aims to bring forth the spirit of “creative activism” within the professions. 

Resonating with the theme of __ARCHIFEST—“Architecture Saving Our World”__, students explored the potential roles of public spaces and other types of social architecture in addressing issues of climate change, public health, social equity and cultural continuity.
